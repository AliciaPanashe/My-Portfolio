      <strong><em>Bag a Toiletry Drive</em></strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      In the grand adventure of life, I chose the path less traveled:
      volunteering. Since I was 18, I've been on a mission to make the world a
      better place, driven by a special passion for helping adolescent girls,
      young women, and the often-overlooked homeless women.
      <br />
      <br />
      Why this focus? Well, while the world tends to spotlight the plight of
      homeless men, the unique struggles faced by homeless women, like the lack
      of basic sanitary needs, often go unnoticed. Picture this: women using
      leaves or scraps of cloth during their period, and not having clean water
      to freshen up. It’s a situation that definitely needed some heroism.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, in 2019, I launched the "Bag a Toiletry" drive. Our goal? To make a
      difference with dignity. We started small, raising 50 bags of toiletries
      (25 for men and 25 for women) to distribute in central Johannesburg. But
      as it turns out, there was a larger need than we’d anticipated. Since
      then, our efforts have grown exponentially. We've managed to distribute
      300 bags of toiletries along with 300 food parcels at each drive, proving
      that even small acts of kindness can snowball into something impactful.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, if you’re ever wondering what drives a person to volunteer, let me
      tell you: it’s the belief that a bit of effort, a dash of compassion, and
      a whole lot of enthusiasm can make a world of difference—even if it means
      tackling the thorny issues with a smile and a can-do attitude.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>
        <em>Empowering the Next Generation: My Journey as a "Girls’ Girl"</em>
      </strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      In a world where the challenges of being a migrant girl are all too real,
      I’ve embraced my role as a staunch advocate for adolescent girls and young
      women. Inspired by my mother—an educator, counsellor, public health
      specialist, and former Doctors Without Borders hero—I’ve set out to create
      a sanctuary where young women can voice their struggles and find support.
      <br />
      <br />
      My mother’s ability to spread hope and joy left an indelible mark on me.
      Watching her transform lives with compassion and expertise, I felt
      compelled to channel that spirit into empowering young women who face
      their own set of hurdles. From the importance of education and sexual
      reproductive health to navigating the complexities of HIV/AIDS and
      employment, our mission is clear: to equip adolescent girls and young
      women with the knowledge and confidence they need to thrive.
      <br />
      <br />
      We’re not just talking about change; we’re making it happen. Through
      workshops, mentorship programs, and community outreach, we’re building a
      brighter future one empowered girl at a time. After all, if there’s one
      thing I’ve learned from my journey, it’s that every girl deserves a safe
      space to grow, learn, and dream big.

      <h4>Education</h4>
      <p class="imp-summary">
        👋🏾 Hi there! I’m Panashe, and if you’re wondering, yes—I’m that rare
        breed who’s addicted to studying and chocolates (the perfect combo😋).
        While others might crave chocolate, I crave it alongside knowledge! I’ve
        been hooked on learning since the tender age of 4, and trust me, it’s
        been quite the journey.
        <br />
        <br />
        I proudly hold a BCom Accounting Degree, but my thirst for knowledge
        didn’t stop there. I’ve also collected an impressive array of
        certifications, including Web Development from SheCodes (because who
        doesn’t want to dabble in code?), Project Management from Howard
        University (thanks, Coursera, for the street cred), Digital Marketing
        from Google Garage (because marketing needs a touch of Google magic),
        TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language—because I love a good
        linguistic challenge), and She Means Business (Online
        Marketing—empowering women and businesses alike).
        <br />
        <br />
        With this diverse toolkit, I’m not just a quick problem solver; I’m
        practically a learning ninja. My eclectic skills make me an invaluable
        team player and a leader who’s always ready to tackle new challenges.
        So, if you’re in need of someone who can blend a love for learning with
        real-world solutions, look no further—I’m your go-to guru!

      <h4>Career</h4>
      <p class="imp-summary">
        My career took off at the tender age of 15, and boy, was it a
        rollercoaster! 🎢, and while my official CV might paint a pretty picture
        of my career, let me give you a sneak peek into some fun and unexpected
        facts that you won’t find on paper!
      </p>
      <ul class="imp-summary">
        <li>
          2013-2015: <strong>Baby Sitting</strong>
          <p>
            I kicked things off with a gig that could rival any superhero origin
            story—babysitting! Picture me as the neighborhood’s youngest and
            most enthusiastic babysitter, armed with a toy box and an infinite
            supply of bedtime stories.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          2014-2015: <strong>Events Promoter</strong>
          <p>
            My next adventure involved selling tickets to events, which was like
            my personal introduction to the world of events management. I was
            the go-to ticket seller, and I discovered my love for organizing and
            promoting events—basically, I was the kid who turned every event
            into a blockbuster hit!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          2014-2015: <strong>Sales Extraordinaire</strong>
          <p>
            Not stopping there, I ventured into the thrilling world of sales,
            hawking watches and perfumes to my fellow pupils. Imagine me as the
            coolest kid in school with a flair for persuasion and a knack for
            making everyone’s wrist and scent game on point!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="imp-summary">
        These early gigs were my crash course in business, people skills, and
        passion for events. They laid the foundation for everything I do today.
        So, if you’re ever in need of someone with a unique blend of experience,
        enthusiasm, and a touch of nostalgia, I’m your person!

            <p>
              Welcome to my PR and events extravaganza at Galaxy Entertainment!
              Over the past six years, I’ve been the wizard behind the curtain,
              orchestrating everything from viral social media campaigns to
              high-energy music festivals.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>What did I do?</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mastered the art of PR and crisis management, ensuring clients’
                brands stayed shiny and reputation intact, even when the
                proverbial storm clouds gathered.
              </li>
              <li>
                Turned events into unforgettable experiences, from speed dating
                soirées to epic music festivals, and everything in between.
              </li>
              <li>
                Juggled event logistics, from venue selection to vendor
                wrangling, making sure every detail was spot on.
              </li>
              <li>
                Became the go-to guru for social media strategies, boosting
                engagement and turning followers into fervent fans.
              </li>
              <li>
                Crafted compelling narratives and persuasive pitches, ensuring
                our clients were always in the spotlight.
              </li>
              <li>
                Led crisis communications with the speed and grace of a seasoned
                pro, minimizing damage and maximizing recovery.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In a nutshell, I was the person who turned ordinary events into
              extraordinary spectacles, keeping clients ahead of the curve and
              making sure their brands shined bright. If you need someone who
              can blend strategic PR with unforgettable events, look no
              further—I’m your secret weapon!

            <h5 class="mt-4">English Tutor (Preply)</h5>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>What did I do?</strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              Since November 2022, I’ve been wielding my English-teaching powers
              on Preply, and let’s just say, if tutoring were a sport, I’d be in
              the major leagues. My job? To transform English learners from
              “Help, I don’t understand” to “I’ve got this!” with lessons as
              personalized as a bespoke suit and as entertaining as a
              blockbuster movie marathon.
              <br />
              <br />
              I managed private lessons like a maestro conducting an orchestra,
              tailoring each session to fit the unique needs and goals of my
              students. My customized learning materials were so engaging that
              students might have thought they were getting a sneak peek into a
              secret language-learning treasure chest.
              <br />
              <br />
              Boasting an exceptional average review rating of 5 stars, I made
              sure every student left my lessons feeling like they’d just aced
              an exam—whether they were preparing for a big test or just trying
              to sound more confident at their next international dinner party.
              My impressive conversion rate of 65% from trial to regular
              students was proof that I could make anyone a fan of English,
              proving that my teaching style was more addictive than a viral
              TikTok trend.
              <br />
              <br />
              Recognized with the coveted Super Tutor Badge on Preply, I was the
              superhero of syntax and the champion of conversations. My mission
              was clear: make learning English fun, effective, and memorable,
              all while earning high-fives (metaphorically, of course) and rave
              reviews.
              <br />
              <br />
              In short, as an English tutor on Preply, I turned language
              learning into an epic adventure, with students leaving each lesson
              feeling like they’d just conquered a new world of words. And if
              they left with a smile and newfound confidence, well, that’s just
              the cherry on top!

            <h5 class="mt-4">Face-to-Face Fundraiser</h5>
            <br />
            <p>
              <strong>What did I do?</strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              As a face-to-face fundraiser from March 2021 to October 2021 with
              Giving Back Fundraising and AIDA Sales and Marketing from January
              2020 to Februar 2021, I was like a personal cheerleader for
              charity—minus the pom-poms but with all the enthusiasm.
              <br />
              <br />
              My role involved devising fundraising strategies that would make
              even the most reserved donor say, “Take my money!” I crafted
              compelling materials that made you feel like you were missing out
              if you didn’t contribute, all while maintaining records with the
              precision of a librarian cataloging rare books.
              <br />
              <br />
              Building relationships with donors and sponsors? Consider me your
              friendly neighborhood connector, creating bonds stronger than a
              superhero's cape. Whether it was charming them into opening their
              wallets or soothing any concerns with the grace of a diplomat, I
              ensured every interaction was as smooth as a well-mixed cocktail.
              <br />
              <br />
              My fundraising ventures spanned supporting World Vision,
              Greenpeace, and Action Aid, proving that my pitch could make
              anyone feel like they were part of a global movement. I juggled
              donor interactions, collaborated with team members, and attended
              meetings like a pro, all while providing customer service that
              could put the best retail associates to shame.
              <br />
              <br />
              In summary, as a face-to-face fundraiser, I turned every
              conversation into an opportunity to support a cause, making giving
              back as appealing as a free sample at a fair. And if I left you
              with a smile and a sense of purpose, well, that’s just the cherry
              on top of a very successful fundraising campaign!

            <p>
              <strong>What did I do?</strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              From May 2017 to April 2018, I was the chief orchestrator of the
              “Show Me Your Number: Big Sister, Little Sister Project,” and
              let’s just say, I turned multitasking into an art form. My role?
              To blend the finesse of a circus performer with the precision of a
              Swiss watchmaker.
              <br />
              <br />
              Picture this: I crafted training materials so engaging, even a
              toddler would stay focused. I recruited facilitators with the kind
              of talent that would make an Oscar winner jealous and then trained
              them to deliver sessions that were more interactive than a viral
              cat video. My job included making sure every facilitator was on
              top of their game, which meant a lot of motivational pep talks and
              the occasional pep talk with a side of coffee.

              When it came to supervising, I was a feedback ninja—swift,
              precise, and always with a smile. I tracked every data point like
              a private investigator on a high-stakes case and churned out
              reports that were more detailed than your favorite mystery novel.
              My round table discussions were legendary, where I expertly
              coordinated logistics and turned potential awkward silences into
              lively debates, all while making sure everyone had a seat and a
              snack.
              <br />
              <br />
              Attending stakeholder meetings, I was the voice of calm and
              clarity, sharing updates and insights with the grace of a
              diplomat. I built relationships with schools and community
              leaders, all while recruiting participants with the enthusiasm of
              a game show host.
              <br />
              <br />
              Mentoring AGYW? I designed and delivered sessions on serious
              topics with the perfect balance of empathy and encouragement. And
              when it came to strategizing, I was the mastermind behind plans so
              solid, they could double as blueprints for world domination—minus
              the villainy.
              <br />
              <br />
              In short, I was the glue holding everything together, proving that
              with a little creativity, a lot of coffee, and a dash of humor,
              even the most complex projects can be a resounding success.

              <strong>What did I do?</strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              From January to April 2017, I took on the role of DREAMS AGYW
              Mentor at the Community Media Trust, and let me tell you, it was a
              whirlwind adventure of epic proportions. My mission? To recruit
              and mentor migrant AGYW (Adolescent Girls and Young Women) in the
              vibrant neighborhoods of Hillbrow and Berea. Think of me as a
              talent scout, but for life skills, not sports—minus the megaphone
              and pom-poms.
              <br />
              <br />
              I led enlightening discussions on HIV/AIDS/STIs, Sexual
              Reproductive Health (SRH), Gender-Based Violence (GBV), and social
              cohesion. My sessions were so engaging that even the toughest
              topics seemed a little less daunting. I also organized
              refreshments because nothing says “we’ve got this” like tackling
              serious subjects with snacks on hand. My motto was always, “Why
              not learn about social issues while enjoying a biscuit?”
              <br />
              <br />
              Reporting and documenting became my secret superpower. I kept
              meticulous records of our sessions, ensuring that every discussion
              and every triumph was captured with the precision of a seasoned
              journalist—except with more highlighters and fewer deadlines. My
              weekly reports were a mix of celebrating successes and identifying
              challenges, always with a sprinkle of optimism and the occasional
              metaphor about climbing mountains.
              <br />
              <br />
              And yes, I diligently marked the register and kept it up to date.
              My register was more organized than a neatly filed library,
              ensuring that every participant was accounted for and every
              session was a step towards empowerment.
              <br />
              <br />
              In short, as a DREAMS AGYW Mentor, I was the friendly face guiding
              young women through crucial life lessons, always with a snack in
              hand and a report ready to document our victories. Empowerment and
              good vibes were my game, and I played it with a smile!
